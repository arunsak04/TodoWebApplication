Services:


1. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
Purpose: JDBC is used to establish a connection between the Java application and a relational database, enabling the storage and retrieval of task-related data.
Functionality: It allows the application to interact with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to perform operations like adding, updating, and retrieving tasks.

2. Servlets:
Purpose: Servlets handle the HTTP requests and responses, acting as the controller in the application's architecture.
Functionality: Servlets receive user requests, process the data, interact with the database through JDBC, and forward the processed information to JSP for presentation.

3. JSP (JavaServer Pages):
Purpose: JSP is responsible for presenting dynamic content to the users, creating a user-friendly interface for task management.
Functionality: JSP pages receive processed data from Servlets and generate dynamic HTML content that is sent back to the user's browser. It allows for the seamless integration of Java code with HTML.

4. Eclipse IDE:
Purpose: Eclipse is the Integrated Development Environment used for Java development.
Functionality: It provides a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging, and deploying Java web applications. Eclipse simplifies the development process by offering features like project management, code completion, and debugging tools.

Key Features of the To-Do Web App:
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their tasks securely.
Task Management: Add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed or pending.
Database Integration: Utilizes JDBC to interact with a backend database for persistent storage.
Dynamic Web Pages: JSP pages generate dynamic content, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
Scalability: The modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional features and future enhancements.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices.

Workflow:
User Registration/Login: Users can register an account or log in to access their personalized to-do lists.
Task Operations: Users can perform various operations on their tasks, such as adding new tasks, updating existing ones, and marking tasks as completed.
Database Interaction: JDBC facilitates the communication between the application and the database to store and retrieve task-related data.
Dynamic Presentation: JSP pages dynamically generate HTML content based on the data received from Servlets.
Responsive User Interface: The web application provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for efficient task management.
